    <h2>User Experience Observations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>My Most Engaged Experience: what part of the experience I engaged with the most?</p>
            <div class="reason">The 3D model interactions were the main part of the experience that I spent the most time engaging in. This is because the 3D models were placed in the foreground and are a distinguishable element of the website. The 3D models were not static, and hard smaller passive animations to suggest to the user that the 3D model was interactive therefore, I felt encouraged to fit interesting interactions by clicking or hovering on as many parts of the 3D model islands.  </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Most Common Interaction: What was the most common action in my first encounter with the website?</p>
            <div class="reason">By analysing the Discrete Actions, it was made clear that the website interactions largely consist of entertaining hover interactions. Thus, most of my time included HOVERING on the elements to gain as much information about the website as possible. It seems that the website utilised hover interactions to either reveal more information or to emphasise certain elements of the website, possibly to entice users to have a more explorative approach to the website. A large portion of the time that I spent on this website was also figuring out the headings/text overlays that were shown on the 3D interactive models. But since the website started entraining me to expect that hovering would give me more information, I tried to hover on everything. While it was slightly frustrating to click/hover on so many buttons to get the information I wanted, I still enjoyed viewing all the interaction-triggered animations to get there. However, this may be an issue if I need to visit this website often as seeing the animations can be tedious. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Impression of the Primary Goal?</p>
            <div class="reason">The first impression of a website moulds the expectations and the effectiveness of usability for the users. Therefore, important for me and other users to clearly understand the purpose of the website when first opened. When I first viewed the website, I thought the website was a mini-game, just for interactive experiments or fun. But when I saw the text overlay that was triggered when hovering over the 3D model, my next impression was that the website was offering some kind of service since the names of the projects were shown. Though, an issue about this was that I did not know these were brand project names, and assumed that they were offering different types of services, which can be considered misleading. Further inconsistency can be observed in the Kitchen Lab menu selection, which was just an interactive gallery. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: I was inclined to identify what information was available at the bottom to figure out the primary goal of the website.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>HOVERED</strong> to view the full names of the roles</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: Realising that the text of the roles was cut off. So I hovered to see if hovering would reveal more information to scan what kinds of roles are available to learn more about what Luni does.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>CLICKED</strong> X button on the top right of the pop-up to close the pop-up</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: The X button is commonly used to symbolise exits on many websites. I wanted to exit the website to discover more about the 3D models I have yet to interact with.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>CLICKED</strong> sandwich menu on the top right, next to the “looking for 12 talents” button</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: Despite my previous intent to <strong>CLICK</strong> on the 3D model islands, I saw that there was a menu button and thought it would be easier to scan. I felt that clicking the 3D models was too uncertain.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>HOVERED</strong> on all the MENU items</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: The menu was a whole page overlay. An interactive image that followed my cursor whenever I hovered on the menu items popped up in the foreground of the menu.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>CLICKED</strong> Coach+</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: I hoped that clicking this would reveal the purpose of the website. Is it a coaching website?</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>SCROLLED DOWN</strong> Coach +</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: To view a pop-up about Coach+ to realise this is a showcase of projects.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>CLICKED</strong> X button on the top right of the pop-up to close the pop-up</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: I had more confidence in what the website was showcasing and found the primary goal of the website through the series of interactions.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>HOVERED</strong> and <strong>CLICKED</strong> the 3D model island “OMADA”</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: Since the primary goal (i.e. what the website was about) was clear to me, I made an inference that <strong>CLICKING</strong> the 3D models would likely showcase a project called OMADA.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>HOVERED</strong> on “Discover OMADA” but wondered if I could scroll</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: To check if scrolling would reveal more information.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>SCROLLED</strong>, resulting in the next project to be shown, SPARK</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: To explore what other projects were available.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>CLICKED</strong> “Discover SPARK”</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: To learn more about the project SPARK.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The pop-up is shown. <strong>SCROLLED DOWN</strong> to view project SPARK</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: To fully explore the details of the SPARK project.</div>
        </li>
