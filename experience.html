    <h2>User Experience Observations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>My Most Engaged Experience: what part of the experience I engaged with the most?</p>
            <div class="reason">The 3D model interactions were the main part of the experience that I spent the most time engaging in. This is because the 3D models were placed in the foreground and are a distinguishable element of the website. The 3D models were not static, and hard smaller passive animations to suggest to the user that the 3D model was interactive therefore, I felt encouraged to fit interesting interactions by clicking or hovering on as many parts of the 3D model islands.  </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Most Common Interaction: What was the most common action in my first encounter with the website?</p>
            <div class="reason">By analysing the Discrete Actions, it was made clear that the website interactions largely consist of entertaining hover interactions. Thus, most of my time included HOVERING on the elements to gain as much information about the website as possible. It seems that the website utilised hover interactions to either reveal more information or to emphasise certain elements of the website, possibly to entice users to have a more explorative approach to the website. A large portion of the time that I spent on this website was also figuring out the headings/text overlays that were shown on the 3D interactive models. But since the website started entraining me to expect that hovering would give me more information, I tried to hover on everything. While it was slightly frustrating to click/hover on so many buttons to get the information I wanted, I still enjoyed viewing all the interaction-triggered animations to get there. However, this may be an issue if I need to visit this website often as seeing the animations can be tedious. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Impression of the Primary Goal?</p>
            <div class="reason">The first impression of a website moulds the expectations and the effectiveness of usability for the users. Therefore, important for me and other users to clearly understand the purpose of the website when first opened. When I first viewed the website, I thought the website was a mini-game, just for interactive experiments or fun. But when I saw the text overlay that was triggered when hovering over the 3D model, my next impression was that the website was offering some kind of service since the names of the projects were shown. Though, an issue about this was that I did not know these were brand project names, and assumed that they were offering different types of services, which can be considered misleading. Further inconsistency can be observed in the Kitchen Lab menu selection, which was just an interactive gallery. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</p>
            <div class="reason">Due to the explorative and interactive nature of this website, it must be established that the Primary Goal and Purpose of the website will be two separate entities, whereas the Purpose is what the website wants the users to experience and the Primary Goal would be what the intended influence the website has on the user. In this website, the Primary Goal of this website is to showcase the works of Luni as a Brand Identity and Product Design service to get clients or employees. And the Purpose is to have the user experience a unique and curiosity-driven exploration. The purpose of a creatively implemented website and the primary goal of getting clients or new employees to work together. As stated previously, it was slightly frustrating to click/hover on so many buttons to get the information I wanted (i.e. finding the primary goal of the website), but I still enjoyed viewing all the interaction-triggered animations to get there. The immersive, interaction-driven experience inspired me to connect more with Luni as a company, which supports the primary goal of converting users to clients or potential candidates. </div>
