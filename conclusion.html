    <h2>Concluding on this user research experience...</h2>

    <p>It is important to look for similarities within the physical world and how references and inspirations transpired to </p>

    <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</li>
            <li> What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</li>
        </ul></h3> 
        <br>
    <p>The two main media form references that I have observed in this website are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gallery/Catalouge</li>
        <li>3D Indie Games</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Gallery/Catalogue Media Form Reference</p>
            <div class="reason"> As shown in the menu page that is triggered by the menu sandwich icon on the top right of the website, and when the user hovers over all the MENU items an interactive image that follows my cursor whenever I hover on the menu items popped up in the foreground of the menu. This initiates a “browsing” entrained behaviour in the user. Utilising the gallery or catalogue reference as a way to prompt the explorative nature of the website further and further, pushes users to users to explore and linger over product descriptions and images. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>3D Indie Game Media Form Referece</p>
            <div class="reason">When the user first loads the website,  the eye-catching, interactive 3D models will be the centre of attention. Thus, inclined to hover on the 3D model to see if there was any interaction. The 3D mode mimics the style of contemporary indie puzzle games, that are styled with a playful or serene colour palette and aesthetics. This is a direct point of the innovative brand of the website and subtly suggests to the users that they can expect the website to have a relatively indirect approach to navigation. This is an extremely important factor for the user experience as it outlines expectations for the users early on in the interactive experience of the website, consequently reducing discomfort for the users. </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</p>
            <div class="reason">Slow transition times, breadcrumbing too much,  indirect interactions or unexpected so many clicks to get to the relevant information, focused too much on showcasing the 3d model
                <ul>
                
                <li>As the website expects the user to fiddle around and figure out which pathway they prefer to navigate to their goal, it is important that the process of navigating feels quick and responsive. If not, the user's experience can feel hindered and incoherent. On this website, the transitions between 3D model scenes feel delayed and laggy because the fade-in/fade-out and the fly-in/fly-out effect have a long duration. </li>
                <li>While understandably, it may look aesthetically pleasing to have this kind of transition style between scenes, or in this context pages, this makes the user experience feel laggy, even if it is intentional. Additionally, the website approaches the explorative interactive experience through breadcrumbing information. In other words, placing buffers to each destination. This makes the time to reach the user goal longer and therefore more tedious to navigate if the user needs to navigate the website multiple times.</li>
                <li>The slow transition times, along with the breadcrumb of information paired with the in-direct interactions that can lead to unexpected outcomes can make the website a frustrating interactive experience. An example of this is, when you click/navigate to the Kitchen, it is unclear what the Kitchen is, which is intended for the playful and explorative experience. The transition into the Kitchen can be described as slow and sometimes the user can confuse this slow transition as unintentional and that the website is not functioning properly.</li>
                <li>The next page is the same 3D model island as the Kitchen Lab 3D Model slang seen on the homepage. This repetition of assets feels redundant. The user is prompted to press another button called “discover.” I would generally expect to see the Kitchen Lab page immediately instead of a repetition of the same 3D model island seen on the homepage. </li>
            </ul></div>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <p>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</p>
            <div class="reason"> Despite this slow transition issue along with the information bread-crumbing issue discussed, there is a menu button the the bottom left
                <ul>
                
                <li>As the website expects the user to fiddle around and figure out which pathway they prefer to navigate to their goal, it is important that the process of navigating feels quick and responsive. If not, the user's experience can feel hindered and incoherent. On this website, the transitions between 3D model scenes feel delayed and laggy because the fade-in/fade-out and the fly-in/fly-out effect have a long duration. </li>
                <li> When loading the website my attention was placed on the bottom right corner of the screen with the loading animation. However, when the website loads, on the same area my eyes were already on, there is the menu button. This strategic placement is very satisfying.</li>
                <li>Additionally, when interacted with (i.e. click interaction), organic and playful animations are triggered. I felt that this design decision was implemented well since the website aesthetics are rounded and playful. The menu items toggle based on the hover of the cursor, further enhancing the interactive feedback design.</li>
                <li>This menu also acts as the guide for the whole website and serves as a straightforward alternative to navigating the website. An anchor. Strategically placed on the bottom right to also feel like it is part of the 3D model island.</li>
