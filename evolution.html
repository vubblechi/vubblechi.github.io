    <h2>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h2> 
    <p>Before I discuss how the interactions that I have made throughout my first experiences with the website, a hypothesis based on my impression of the website may help observe any discrepancies between user expectations and user actions. In this section, I will list a timeframe and a hypothesis on how the websiteâ€™s experience should be interacted with over different periods/durations. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Inferences on Interactive Behaviour Based on Impressions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>1st Time Visiting for 2 - 5 Minutes</p>
            <div class="reason">Impression: The user has an explorative approach to navigating the website. It is expected that there will be a more playful and a more playful, though uncertain interaction behaviour. 
                Reason: This is because the UI web design and the interaction design can be considered innovative and unique, as it is not a common thing to implement 3D interactables in websites. Therefore, the experience will feel unfamiliar to the users. 
                </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>1st Time Visiting 5 - 10 Minutes</p>
            <div class="reason">Impression: This would be the familiarisation phase when the user becomes less risk averse and understands that the website asks you to be experimental with the interactions (e.g. instead of scrolling, try clicking and dragging around the gallery)
                Reason:  The interactives allow multiple pathways to get to the same destination on the website, and as the user gets more familiar with the website, this is made clear. And thus, encourages the user to think more creatively. 
                </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2nd Time Visiting 2 - 5 Minutes</p>
            <div class="reason">Impression: The user already understands that this website can feel unfamiliar, but is confident that the website has a use. At this stage, the user will start testing different pathways to get the information they want.
                Reason: This is because the user would be already familiar with the creative interactable visuals, triggers and behaviours. 
                </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>2nd Time Visiting 5 - 10 Minutes</p>
            <div class="reason">Impression: The user would have figured out their preferred way of navigating the website.
                Reason: This is due to the website's multiple options for users to navigate to their goals. </div>
        </li>

    <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2> 
    <p>So now that the impressions on how the website should be experienced throughout time are established. Is it important to look at how the interactive design of the website prompted my impressions of how the experience should evolve?</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>So what is an interactive experience?? An interactive experience is how the user can participate in the website</li> 
        <li>Using interactive design to guide the users throughout the website. Creating a holistic experience through user engagement with the website's user interface 
        </li>
        <li>The user will see an element within the user interface of a website and will be prompted to interact with the element. This encourages users to take action on the interface to trigger feedback.  
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Influence of Interaction Design on User Behaviour and Experience</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>1st Time Visiting for 2 - 5 Minutes</p>
            <div class="reason">Interaction (action + trigger + feedback): Animated 3D model islands invite the user to hover over the models to expect an interaction. Has animation feedback triggered by hovering, however, does not reveal more information about the website. 
                Experience: a sense of unfamiliarity and novelty. Thus, the user has an explorative approach to navigating the website. It is expected that there will be a more playful and a more playful, though uncertain interaction behaviour. This links to the primary goal of creating hype for the brand and entices clients/employees to get involved.
                </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>1st Time Visiting 5 - 10 Minutes</p>
            <div class="reason">Interaction (action + trigger + feedback): Exploring the visuals triggered by hovering. Throughout the website, more information is revealed once the user has more interactions with the website. Especially, when hovering over all the menu items. The menu was a whole page overlay and an interactive image that followed my cursor whenever I hovered over the menu items. When I hovered to view the full names of the roles, I realised that the text of the roles was cut off. So I hovered to see if hovering would reveal more information to scan what kinds of roles are available to learn more about what Luni does. This balances the explorative approach to navigating the website whilst engaging the user to read more about the website. </div>
