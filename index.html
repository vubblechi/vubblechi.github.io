    <p> Delving into my experience of an Award-winning website, <strong> luni.app </strong> </p>
    </Article>

    <h2>First Impressions</h2> 
    <p>When loading the website my attention was placed on the bottom right corner of the screen with the loading animation. However, when the website loads, on the same area my eyes were already on, there is the menu button. Despite this, I was not inclined to interact with the menu button at first, as the eye-catching, interactive 3D models caught my attention. Thus, I immediately started hovering on the 3D model to see if there was any interaction</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>I first observed the hover animation and feedback, where I would have on different islands and the colour/text overlay would change and modulate depending on where my cursor is. I felt that the sudden change of text overlay was smoothed out by the animation being in synchrony with all the other elements of the 3D interaction, such as the transition between different overlays being a quick radial transition to create a “bouncy” effect that suited the round aesthetics of the entire website.</li> 
        <li>This effectively creates a cohesive experience. It took me over 5 minutes to figure out what the website was about despite all these cool interactive designs because I failed to see the small text flanked on the left side of the 3D models. Despite the 3D model being the prime focus in the website hierarchy, the text overlays when hovered were confusing, as I expected to know more information about the website if I hovered. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Actions Taken on the Website</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>HOVER</strong> on the 3D model elements to uncover potential information </p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: The 3D model was central to the web design and was animated. Thus, suggested to me it may be interactive.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>HOVER</strong> over the bottom right menu button to view menu options</p>
            <div class="reason">Reason: To reveal information to scan the website.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Saw the “looking for 12 talents” on the top right and <strong>CLICKED</strong> on the 12 talent button
            <div class="reason">Reason: The text “12 talents” was specific and attracted me to click on it in hopes of uncovering the primary goal of the website.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            The pop-up is shown - <strong>SCROLLED DOWN</strong>
            <div class="reason">Reason: I was inclined to identify what information was available at the bottom to figure out the primary goal of the website.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>HOVERED</strong> to view the full names of the roles
            <div class="reason">Reason: Realising that the text of the roles was cut off. So I hovered to see if hovering would reveal more information to scan what kinds of roles are available to learn more about what Luni does.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CLICKED</strong> X button on the top right of the pop-up to close the pop-up
            <div class="reason">Reason: The X button is commonly used to symbolise exits on many websites. I wanted to exit the website to discover more about the 3D models I have yet to interact with.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CLICKED</strong> sandwich menu on the top right, next to the “looking for 12 talents” button
            <div class="reason">Reason: Despite my previous intent to <strong>CLICK</strong> on the 3D model islands, I saw that there was a menu button and thought it would be easier to scan. I felt that clicking the 3D models was too uncertain.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>HOVERED</strong> on all the MENU items
            <div class="reason">Reason: The menu was a whole page overlay. An interactive image that followed my cursor whenever I hovered on the menu items popped up in the foreground of the menu.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CLICKED</strong> Coach+
            <div class="reason">Reason: I hoped that clicking this would reveal the purpose of the website. Is it a coaching website?</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SCROLLED DOWN</strong> Coach +
            <div class="reason">Reason: To view a pop-up about Coach+ to realise this is a showcase of projects.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CLICKED</strong> X button on the top right of the pop-up to close the pop-up
            <div class="reason">Reason: I had more confidence in what the website was showcasing and found the primary goal of the website through the series of interactions.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>HOVERED</strong> and <strong>CLICKED</strong> the 3D model island “OMADA”
            <div class="reason">Reason: Since the primary goal (i.e. what the website was about) was clear to me, I made an inference that <strong>CLICKING</strong> the 3D models would likely showcase a project called OMADA.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>HOVERED</strong> on “Discover OMADA” but wondered if I could scroll
            <div class="reason">Reason: To check if scrolling would reveal more information.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SCROLLED</strong>, resulting in the next project to be shown, SPARK
            <div class="reason">Reason: To explore what other projects were available.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>CLICKED</strong> “Discover SPARK”
            <div class="reason">Reason: To learn more about the project SPARK.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            The pop-up is shown. <strong>SCROLLED DOWN</strong> to view project SPARK
            <div class="reason">Reason: To fully explore the details of the SPARK project.</div>
        </li>
