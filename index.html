    <h1>Experience Research</h1>
    <h2> A series of prompt related research</h2>
    <h3> By Sachi Ruaya</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Select an interactive web project to research from the list in the modules and provide short written responses to the following prompts about your experience interaction</li>
        <li>Your responses need to be collated and presented as a web page by writing them into a single HTML document using semantically appropriate elements with a linked CSS file to provide contextually appropriate styling. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> These are the prompts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
    </ul>
